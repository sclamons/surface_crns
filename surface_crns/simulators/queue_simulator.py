    Surface CRN simulator based on Gillespie-like next-reaction determination
    at each node. Upcoming reactions are stored in a priority queue, sorted
    by reaction time. Each time an event occurs, the next reaction time for
    each participating node is recalculated and added to the queue. Timestamps
    are used to ensure that a node does not react if it was changed between the
    time its reaction was issued and the time the reaction would occur.

    Uses unimolecular and bimolecular reactions only.
